Rowdies is a Latin display typeface inspired by the rough & tough Indian action cinema. Roughness and oddness of each individual letter contribute collectively as a typeface to the fantasy of being bold, fearless and strong.

Designed by Jaikishan Patel for action, drama, adventure, thriller, noir & crime genres of storytelling.

The font family includes 600+ glyphs in 3 weights; Light, Regular, and Bold.
